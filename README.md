Documentation for the variables in the source UCI HAR dataset can be found in the 'README.txt' and 'features_info.text' files in the 'UC HAR Dataset' directory of this repository.

In the tidy_data.csv output file, the column names have been generated by joining the labels in 'features.txt' with the corresponding observation columns.

In the summary_stats.csv output file, the column names have been generated by joining the labels in 'features.txt' with the corresponding observation columns, and appending '_mean' to reflect the fact that the mean of the column value has been taken for this summary statistic.
